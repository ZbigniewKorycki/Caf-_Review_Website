<h1>Cafe Review Website</h1>

The Cafe Review Website is a Flask web application that allows users to submit and view reviews for different cafes. Users can provide information about the cafe's name, location, opening and closing times, and rate the cafe's coffee quality, WiFi, and power availability.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 62.
